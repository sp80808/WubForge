MDA SubSynth Controls Added to WubForge UI:

Type selector: 4 modes
- Distort: Harmonic enhancement with clipping
- Divide: Octave division for subharmonic generation
- Invert: Filtered octave shifting
- Key Osc: Triggered sine wave oscillator

Parameters:
- Wet Mix: Amount of sub-bass enhancement (0-100%)
- Dry Mix: Amount of original bass preserved (0-100%)
- Threshold: Trigger level for processing (-60dB to 0dB)

These controls provide access to the legendary MDA bass processing
algorithms that have been battle-tested in professional studios for
over 20 years.

Default settings for bass enhancement:
- Type: Distort (for gentle sub-bass enhancement)
- Wet: 30% (subtle but noticeable bass boost)
- Dry: 100% (preserve original bass)
- Threshold: -24dB (typical for trigger-based effects)
