## Overview

WubForge is evolving from a basic spectral processor into a "Dubstep Forge" with 2025-era features including sample morphing, gun bass FM synthesis, tearout rhythm modulation, and advanced filtering techniques.

## Current Architecture Status

The plugin currently features:
- Modular 5-slot processing chain
- Spectral morphing capabilities
- Fractal filtering system
- Key-tracked parameter modulation
- Professional DSP library integration (chowdsp_utils)
- Real-time spectrogram visualization

## 2025 Enhancement Plan

The next phase adds Serum 2-style sample morphing and dubstep production techniques while maintaining the existing modular architecture and performance standards (<15% CPU usage).
