# WubForge Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals
- **Transform WubForge into a "Dubstep Forge"** with Serum 2-style sample morphing, gun bass FM synthesis, tearout rhythm modulation, and enhanced filtering techniques
- **Maintain modular architecture** and <15% CPU performance target
- **Integrate novel DSP algorithms** like Fibonacci Spiral Distort for unique bass processing capabilities

## Key Features & Modules

### âœ… Completed
- **SampleMorpher Module**: Granular sample-to-bass processing with drag-and-drop .wav support
- **Fibonacci Spiral Distort (FSD)**: Novel hybrid filter-distortion using golden ratio spacing for self-similar harmonics, creating self-similar, consonant harmonics using golden ratio (Ï† â‰ˆ 1.618) spacing and Fibonacci approximations for "pleasing" richness without dissonance. Implemented with Ï†-resonator bank, Fibonacci distortion cascade, and spiral veil filter, with real-time performance optimizations for <3% CPU usage.

### ðŸš§ In Progress

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Enhancements
- **Gun Bass FM Engine**: Tearout/riddim FM synthesis with 8-voice unison
- **Tearout Rhythm System**: LFO bank and phaser system for dubstep rhythms
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Gaussian Bin-Shave LP with spectral smoothing
- **Dubstep Forge Mode**: One-click preset for tearout bass production

## Completion Criteria
- **Performance**: <15% CPU usage with full 5-slot chain
- **Sound Quality**: Professional-grade dubstep bass synthesis
- **Usability**: Intuitive controls for both beginners and experts
- **Novelty**: Unique algorithms that differentiate from existing plugins
