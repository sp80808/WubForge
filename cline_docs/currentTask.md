# Current Task: Find and Implement Open Source UI Libraries

## Objective
Research and implement appropriate open source UI libraries for real-time audio visualization components in the WubForge plugin, specifically focusing on spectrograph and spectrum analysis visualizations that integrate with the JUCE framework.

## Context
WubForge is planned to include a "Real-time Visual Feedback" feature with a full-screen spectrograph showing harmonic evolution. The plugin uses JUCE framework and needs visualization components for:

- Spectral analysis display
- Real-time spectrograms
- Audio waveform visualization
- Oscilloscope-like displays

## Current Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

- Created custom SpectrogramComponent using JUCE graphics framework
- Integrated real-time waterfall-style spectrogram display
- Added logarithmic frequency scaling and color mapping
- Connected to plugin's DSP pipeline for spectral data visualization
- Replaced placeholder visualization with functional spectrogram

## Technical Implementation

### SpectrogramComponent Features
- **Waterfall-style visualization**: Shows frequency content evolution over time
- **Logarithmic frequency scaling**: Accurate representation of human hearing response
- **Multiple color maps**: Viridis (default), Plasma, and Hot color schemes
- **Configurable display**: Time window (0.1-10s), frequency range (10Hz-22kHz)
- **Performance optimized**: 30fps update rate with real-time display
- **Frequency labels**: Octave reference lines and time markers

### Integration Details
- **Data source**: SpectralMorphingModule FFT magnitude data
- **JUCE integration**: Uses juce::Component and juce::Graphics for rendering
- **Buffer management**: Circular buffer for time history storage
- **Thread-safe**: Proper data handling between audio and GUI threads

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1. Add oscilloscope/oscilloscope component when needed
2. Implement waveform visualization overlay
3. Add spectral analysis metrics and displays
4. Consider adding waveform export functionality
5. Implement advanced color schemes and themes

## Results
The spectrogram component is now fully functional and will display real-time spectral data when a SpectralMorphingModule is loaded into the processing chain. The implementation uses pure JUCE graphics capabilities for optimal performance and integration, avoiding external library dependencies.
