# Current Task: Find and Implement Open Source UI Libraries

## Objective
Research and implement appropriate open source UI libraries for real-time audio visualization components in the WubForge plugin, specifically focusing on spectrograph and spectrum analysis visualizations that integrate with the JUCE framework.

## Context
WubForge is planned to include a "Real-time Visual Feedback" feature with a full-screen spectrograph showing harmonic evolution. The plugin uses JUCE framework and needs visualization components for:

- Spectral analysis display
- Real-time spectrograms
- Audio waveform visualization
- Oscilloscope-like displays

## Current Status
- Project documentation structure established
- Requirements analysis complete
- Need to identify suitable open source libraries

## Next Steps
1. Research JUCE-compatible open source visualization libraries
2. Evaluate available spectrograph/plotting libraries
3. Assess integration complexity and licensing
4. Implement selected UI components
5. Integrate with existing PluginEditor.cpp
6. Test real-time performance

## Technical Requirements
- Compatible with JUCE graphics framework
- Real-time capable (60fps minimum)
- Open source licensing
- Audio DSP integration capabilities
- Professional visual quality
